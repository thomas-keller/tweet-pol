# tweet-pol

Materials and methods for a series of blog posts beginning on 2016-04-06 by [Thomas E. Keller](http://thomas-keller.github.io) about datamining the republican and democatic parties of the US goverment for the 2016 election.

Code is a combination of python and R code, and is heavily based (ie would denote forked if I had known how to properly fork at the time) on the smappR package by [Pablo Barbera](https://github.com/SMAPPNYU/smappR). 

Tweets were collected over a period beginning xxx and ending xxx. The sampling schema used the Twitter "garden-hose" , which is a quasi-random feed of approximately 1% of tweets being broadcast at any given time. 

I had access to the Georgia Institute of Technology Pace cluster computing grid during this time, which led me offload the twitter listening and storage component part of the project, thankfully. Ths PBS bash and R scripts I used are included.
